I unlocked your side
It got dark and we went north
Trying to peek through driving snow
And I listened to you low

Outside the wind got fast and cold
And made a tiny sound, the ghostly blow
You sang low, I listened close

I tried to join you in your note
The three parts surprised us both
We three: you and me and the blow!

(It will be grey when we get home
I listen close, you keep me warm)
